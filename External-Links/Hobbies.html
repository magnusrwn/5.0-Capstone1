    <p>Surfing is possibly my faveroute thing to do... As in, out of everything i could possibly do, surfing would 
        prpbebly be number one.  Aside from day-drinking.
        <br />
        <br />
        I have surfed in a few places arround the globe, but mainly home and in a surf town in Portugal Called Peniche.  Some
        spots in the town are 
        <ul>
            <li>Supertubos - World Famous Heavy Barreling A-frame Beach Break</li>
            <li>Lagide - Breaking over a rock reef by clifs, super quick take-off.  Maily a Left, but you can do right.</li>
            <li>Baleal Beach/s - Massive number of briliant breaks over the Peninsula.  Waves everywhere for everyone</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        I love to go places, and travel and see things and experience people.  
        For me, theres just something about meeting and experiencing new people and 
        cultures that calls to me.
        <br />
        <br />
        Recently I've just realised how trully good/ nice London is... And how it's right there... 
        which is super good as I would love to go there allot more.  
        And luckily now with the end of school, i can!
